# Changes made since Part II
> Include few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II. 

There has been alot of changes made since Part II. I will discuss them in sections.
 
**Headers**
I created headers to create a self-guided experience for the reader. Initially the site was not set up for someone to understand the flow of everything. There were "big ideas" to get a general sense of what I was trying to say. I am hoping this new approach will make it clear exactly what I am saying.

**Images/Videos**

People liked that I added the images of the shoes I was talked about because it helped them see what the shoe looked like. Instead of adding images of sneakers I decided to add more videos instead.  This would not only let me people see the shoe I was talking about but now they can get a more detailed experience when watching the video. So far I was only able to get reaction for students in the class during the presentation towards the Tik Tok video that autoplayed but they seemed to enjoy that new feature. The videos help the user get a 360 view of the shoe. 

**Charts**
Gener

Throughout my interviews and class discussions there were conflicts on which graphs to choose. 

Most people in my class discussion liked my graphs but the people I interviewed outside of the class had trouble understanding some charts. Mainly the graphs I originally had in  Tableau. They were confusing to them. So I ended up changing the treemap to a word cloud. I aslo changed the data represented in the bar chart to focus more on the revenue the platforms are making as average price sold on on each platform.

There were clearly some bias opinions on what shoes should be displayed from interviewers. Most of my interviewers are Nike and Yeezy fans. And after a discussion with the professor I decided to focus on three charts. I did not like the contionous scrolling I was doing the charts. I wanted to hit the point sooner. 

I also tried to match the line charts with the colors of the shoes but kept the color of the retail the price. I really wanted to emphasize the return on investment people were making on the resell market and what they were not making. 
 


**Call to Action**
I originally had the call to action to go straight into the resell market but that was not a good idea especially if they are new. They would most likely not know what to do and get overwhelmed with all the options. Instead I added some links to youtube channels of sneaker enthusiasts that give good reviews on sneakers and the platforms. This way newbies can find more ways to learn before jumping in to try their first sale.

 
## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

My audience are sneaker enthusiasts who are interested in getting into sneaker reselling. I tried to focus my story more for someone who is new to this industry and give more insights on the reason why sneakers sell for such high prices. 

## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story.

# Final thoughts
> You can summarize any final thoughts / reflections that don't fit well in the previous sections here.  How did it go?  What did you run out of time for, or wish you had a chance to revisit?  What were you most excited about?  Include any final reflections as you think they might help us understand your process.  If you already included such reflections elsewhere, you can delete this section.
