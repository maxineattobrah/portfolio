# About Me

I am a second year masters student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am pursuing a MS in Electrical & Computer Engineering and MS in Engineering & Technology Innovation Management. My passion lies within the intersection of technology, business and art. My courses have been centered around data science, machine learning and entrepreneurship. I like to write about various topics under the artificial intelligence umbrella. You can check some of my articles [here](https://medium.com/@maxineattobrah) 😄

I also have done a few data science/machine learning competitions on Kaggle. [Join me](https://www.kaggle.com/maxineattobrah) and lets form a team for the next competition! 🦾

In my free time I love to go to art exhibits 🎨, hang out friends/family ♥️, work out 🏋️‍♀️, try new tech 👩‍💻 and play with legos 🧱.


# What I Hope To Learn

Data can seem very complicated and overwhelming at first. During the exploratory data analsysis phase 🕵️‍♀️ 📈  there are important insights that can be uncovered. As an aspiring data scientists/machine learning engineer, entrepreneur and educator working in innovation, it is important for me to be able to make this clear. I would like to be able to effectively show important findings in data so that any type of audience can understand and interact with that data. I want to learn the most effective ways to tell meaningful stories with data.
