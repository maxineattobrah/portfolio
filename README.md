# About Me

I am a second year masters student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am pursuing a MS in Electrical & Computer Engineering and MS in Engineering & Technology Innovation Management. My passion lies within the intersection of technology, business and art. I am very interested in data science and machine learning. 


# What I Hope To Learn

Data can seem very complicated and overwhelming at first. During the exploratory data analsysis phase there are important insights that can be uncovered. As an aspiring data scientists, entrepreneur and educator working in innovation it is important for me to be able to make this clear. I would like to be able to effectively show important findings in data so that any type of audience can understand and interact with that data. I want to learn the most effective ways to tell meaningful stories with data.
