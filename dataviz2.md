# Analyzing Debt-to-GDP Ratios Around the World Using Data Visualtions

The charts below use data from the Organization of Economic Co-operation Development (OECD). The OECD is a global organization that assists in creating policies that improve the lives of others socially, economically and enviromentally. The data analyszed below represents the Debt-to-GDP ratio from various countries. This ratio is a way to see how much debt a country is in. 

The goal of this asignment is to try different ways to display the data provided by the OECD.

## Debt-to-GDP Ratios Around the World (2021) - OECD

The above chart is directly from the OECD site. There were a range of dates to choose from but I decided to choose the year 2021 because that was the most recent data. The original chart does a nice job in showing which countries was in the most debt in 2021 by usung a bar chart. You can see Japan had the most and Estonia had the least compared to all the countries shown.

The chart above gives each country its own plot and shows trend of debt throughout multiple years. This helps to see if the country debt is getting better or worse with time. It is also just nice to see how each country is doing on its own without being forced to compare it to all the countries. This graph seems to be best if you wanted to see how a country is doing individually. I decided to use because it is a neutral color. I tried to give the graph a title to give it more context.

This is the same data displayed in heatmap. In this chart you can see what countries are doing well compared to the other. However, you can see which countries are doing really bad. I decided to use green and red because I felt that diverging colors to show contrasting views clearly and fast. We can see that countries that are doing are green and see if they get progressively worse through out the yearsby using a color transition. Greece, United Kingdom and the US were doing okay in the beginning but we can clearly see it get worse. I picked this tile because I did not feel the y-axis or x-axis gave enough context to what people were looking at.
