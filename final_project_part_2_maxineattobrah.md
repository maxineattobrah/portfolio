# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

There are various options people have to invest their money and I wanted to focus on an alternative approach to investing in the stock market or real estate. This is a fun way to invest money as opposed to being very serious. Sneakers come with color, culture and art. There is alot that goes into sneaker reselling. 

Below is my initial wireframe. I chose to jump straight in using Shorthand for this so I can put all my thoughts in one place. I wanted to use images and data that would grab the readers attention. I chose images and figures that get me excited. I wanted to start the story off by giving a brief overview of important things people needed to know to get started if they wanted to try it out today. 

The flow starts off with an overview which on into the top platforms to look into and the top sneaker brands sought out for. Next it shows off some shoes that have done well to get people, then shows shoes that have not done well to remind people to be cautious and important things to keep into consideration. 

Finally I provide some resources of how people can learn more about reselling sneakers. 

I wanted to use both Tableau as well Flourish as a data visualization too to stretch myself. I think both tools have their advantages and give me option to express myself in different ways using data visualizations. I was undecided towards which sneakers to keep as examples. I am hoping my interviewers can help me narrow the images down and tell a better story that they care about.

# User research 

## Target audience
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story. 

A sneakerhead is a person who collects, trades and/or admires sneakers. My target audience are people who are passionate about sneakers and are considering reselling sneakers. 

My approach to identifying representatives is by reaching out to people within my network. I am a sneakerhead and I have friends who are sneakerheads as well so I plan on interviewing some of them. 

I also want to get opinions from people in the general public because I want this guide to be clear for anyone who is interested in considering sneaker reselling as an option of income.   


## Interview script
> List the goals from your research, and the questions you intend to ask. 

I thought of a few questions that would help me see if the flow of my story is clear and would be helpful to someone new reselling snekaers. 

| Goal                                         | Questions to Ask                                      |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|

| Check If My Story is Clear                   | Can you describe to me what this is telling you?      |
| Check If I Missed Anything                   | Are there any things you would like to see?           |
| See What I Can Remove                        | Were there any things you did not care about?         |
| Check If My Story is Clear                   | Anything you found confusing?                         |
| Ensure MY Call To Action Is Clear            | What actions would you take after reading this?       |
| See If I Should Stick With The Charts I Have | Is there anything you like/dislike about the charts?  |
| See If I Should Stick With The Charts I Have | Is there any particular type of chart you like better?|

## Interview findings
> Detail the findings from your interviews.  Do not include PII.  Capture specific insights where possible.

I tried to keep my focus to people in my target audience. I intentionaly avoided asking questions to more established sneaker resellers since they are already doing my call to action. Some of the questions were answered in other questions so there was no need to ask it twice.

# In-Class Discussion


We had an in class discussion where were in groups of 4 and gave each other feedback on our rough drafts. People in group liked the flow of my story and liked that I had a picture to show each show. They were not a fan of the amount of lines charts I have. They thought it was too many and I dhould find a way to tell the story with less charts. They wanted to see percentages on some of the charts. Some inspirations that came about from that discussion was to keep the color of the retail price the same for all charts but chage the color of the resale price to match the shows. Majority of the group liked the tree map because it emphaszed how dominant certain brands are but they suggested to increase the font and/or change the color.

> ...include any final thoughts you have here. 

The interviews were helpdul. It helps me make my story more concise. It also helps me to see what sneakerheads care about to have a broader view. Making the line plots into a dashboard is a creative idea but I want to see if there is a way to do that without loosing the audience attention or making it look too busy. 

# Moodboards / personas
> If you did this optional part, include details here.  Otherwise remove this section

I dedecided to create a persona for a sneakerhead. Steve is passionate about sneakers. He wants to start reselling sneakers. I used some data found in this [article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/you-see-sneakers-these-guys-see-hundreds-of-millions-in-resale-profit/) to help create my persona. Campless did a survey and over 1000 sneakerheads responded.
